This program is being built to help calculate odds for a single player playing single deck blackjack against a dealer. 

To run the program run ruby blackjackprogram.rb

To run the specs run blackjack_spec.rb

I am hoping to build out more features and make the program more dynamic by providing calculated odds and also integrating other potential players at the table.

Let me know any thoughts/suggestions on the code or the program!

Thanks,
Blane
